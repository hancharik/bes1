# The BES particle simulator
10/23/15
this is a particle simulator, with and without gravity

there is a periodic table of the elements that creates an atom based on the physics of the game.

the forces are not taking into account vectors, I think that there is a sine/cosine solution for this, once we implement that, there are the sub-orbital concerns in the periodic table

there need to be more presets, there needs to be a working solar system  -  we need the trig solved first
